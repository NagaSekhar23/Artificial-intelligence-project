# Image Stitching Pipeline using SIFT

## Overview

This project implements a complete image stitching pipeline using the **Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)** algorithm for feature detection and matching. The goal is to automatically align and blend overlapping photographs to create a seamless panoramic image.

## Objectives

- Detect and match features between overlapping images using SIFT.
- Estimate the transformation between images to align them.
- Blend the aligned images into a single panoramic view.

## Project Details

This is an **individual project**. You are expected to complete all tasks independently.

### Provided Components
- Pre-implemented pipeline components for image loading, preprocessing, and visualization.
- Code structure with clear `TODO` blocks for your implementation.

### Your Responsibilities
- Replace each `TODO` block with your own code.
- Add additional cells in the notebook as needed to support your implementation.
- Ensure the final pipeline produces a high-quality panoramic image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (with SIFT support)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (or compatible environment)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run the cells in order, implementing the code where indicated.
4. Test your implementation with various sets of overlapping images.

## Submission

Submit your completed notebook with all code implemented and results displayed.
