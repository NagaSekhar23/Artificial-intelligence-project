# Project: Forward-Backward Verification

## Overview
This project focuses on verifying solutions to mathematical or logical problems using both forward and backward verification methods. It includes the analysis of:
- Problem 1(e): Forward and backward verification
- Problem 2A: Verification
- Problem 2B: Verification

The goal is to ensure correctness by validating results from both the initial input (forward) and the final output (backward), which helps detect errors and improve reliability.

## Objectives
- Validate solutions through dual verification.
- Ensure consistency between forward and backward steps.
- Document and analyze results for accuracy.

## Key Features
- Implementation of forward verification (step-by-step solution).
- Implementation of backward verification (checking results from output).
- Application to specific problems: 1(e), 2A, and 2B.

## Usage
1. Run the verification scripts or methods.
2. Compare forward and backward results.
3. Review outputs for consistency.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x (or relevant language/tools)
- NumPy / SymPy (if used for symbolic math)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for documentation)
