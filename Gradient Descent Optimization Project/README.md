## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing a mathematical function, f(x), through two primary tasks:

1. **Graphical Representation**: Visualize the function f(x) to understand its behavior.
2. **Optimization**: Use gradient descent to minimize the function f(x), demonstrating an iterative approach to finding the minimum value.

## Objectives

- To graphically represent the function f(x) and analyze its properties.
- To apply gradient descent, a common optimization algorithm, to find the minimum value of f(x).

## Key Components

- **Function f(x)**: The mathematical function to be analyzed and minimized.
- **Gradient Descent Algorithm**: An iterative method used to find the minimum of a function.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of f(x) to aid in understanding its behavior.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define the Function**: Specify the mathematical form of f(x).
2. **Graph the Function**: Use plotting tools to visualize f(x).
3. **Implement Gradient Descent**: Write code to iteratively minimize f(x).
4. **Analyze Results**: Examine the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm and the final minimum value.
